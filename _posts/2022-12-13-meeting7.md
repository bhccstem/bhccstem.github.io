The STEM club is now official in the eyes of the SGA! After the break, all project groups will have access to funding.

The STEM club is looking to plan a field trip to the Museum of Science alongside the Pre-med Society. This would take place after the break. We would like to get a headcount of everyone who would like to go. If interested please RSVP: [(link)](https://tinyurl.com/468zbukk)
