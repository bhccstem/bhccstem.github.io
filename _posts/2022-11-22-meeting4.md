title: Project details and Merch discussion
---

Continued discussion on the club projects - more details can be be found in the project-specific Discord channels. Also introduced some merch designs for the club and brainstormed possible production/distribution methods.

We are still accepting designs for club merch, including shirts, sweaters, sweatpants/joggers, hoodies, and beanies. Please include the [logo](https://bhccstem.github.io/images/logo.png) in all designs. Email all submissions to Jessica (jessica.schneider@bhcc.edu) and we will vote on them in a future meeting.

Reminder: there will be a conversation with a guest speaker from an engineering firm: December 1st, 10am-11am, Charlestown Campus, Room B329. More details to come.
